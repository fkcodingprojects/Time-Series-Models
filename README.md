# Time Series Analysis of Mean Temperature using Various Models

This repository contains code and documentation for the analysis of mean temperature time series data using a variety of models, including ARIMA, GRU, RNN, ETS, and LSTM. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling to better understand the underlying patterns and trends in the mean temperature data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before applying any modeling techniques, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the mean temperature time series data. The following EDA steps were performed:

1. **Data Overview**: A brief description of the dataset, its sources, and its potential applications in climate analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean the data, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles were computed to understand the central tendencies and variations in the data.

4. **Time Series Plots**: Line plots were generated to visualize the temporal variations in mean temperature. These plots help identify any long-term trends or seasonality patterns.

5. **Histograms**: Histograms were created to visualize the distribution of mean temperature values and assess their skewness or kurtosis.

6. **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation matrices and heatmaps were constructed to measure the relationships between mean temperature and other relevant variables, providing insights into potential dependencies.

7. **Box Plots**: Box plots were utilized to detect outliers and observe the distribution of mean temperature across different time periods.

8. **Violin Plots**: Violin plots were generated to combine box plots with probability density estimation, providing a richer understanding of the data distribution.

## Model Implementation

After gaining insights from the exploratory analysis, various time series modeling techniques were applied to the mean temperature data:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: This classic time series model was fitted to capture the autoregressive and moving average components of the data.

2. **ETS (Exponential Smoothing State Space Model)**: ETS models were employed to capture seasonality, trends, and noise in the data using exponential smoothing methods.

3. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: These deep learning models were trained to capture complex temporal dependencies in the data, leveraging the power of recurrent neural networks.

4. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: A basic RNN model was also employed to compare its performance with the more advanced GRU and LSTM models.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data**: Contains the raw and preprocessed mean temperature datasets used in the analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis, modeling approaches, and results.
- **plots**: Visualizations generated during the EDA process, including time series plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and more.
- **models**: Code and saved weights for the implemented ARIMA, ETS, GRU, RNN, and LSTM models.
- **README.md**: The current documentation providing an overview of the repository's contents and the analysis performed.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a comprehensive analysis of mean temperature time series data using a range of modeling techniques. The combination of exploratory data analysis and modeling provides valuable insights into the patterns and trends within the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of climate variability over time. The results from the various models offer different perspectives on modeling time series data and can guide further research in this domain.
